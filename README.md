## Getting Started (builing the website locally) 🛠

To get starting developing, we really recommend to clone the website locally and start developing on your machine. 

This will allow you to **preview what the generated site** will look like in your browser locally. Jekyll comes also with a *auto-regenerate* feature, this will allow you to quickly iterate over different changes to the website (useful if you're touching the CSS files). More info about the *auto-regenerate* feature on the [Jekyll usage page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/).

### Linux

1. Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) with your package manager.
```
Debian
sudo apt install ruby

ArchLinux
sudo pacman -S ruby
```

2. Clone this repository (you need `git` installed).
```
git clone https://github.com/gdgpisa/gdgpisa.github.io.git
cd gdgpisa.github.io/
```

3. To configure gems user-wide add the following line to your shell configuration files, for example `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`
```

```

4. Open your terminal and install `jekyll` and `bundler`
```

```

5. To run executable gems, without typing the full location, run the following command or add it to your shell configuration files, for example `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`.
```
PATH=$(ruby -e 'print Gem.user_dir')/bin:$PATH
```

6. To install gems into `GEM_HOME`
```
bundle install
```

## Writing a post 📝

To add a new post to the blog page, you need to create a new file in the [`_post`](https://github.com/gdgpisa/gdgpisa.github.io/tree/master/_posts) folder. Please follow the naming of the file, like:
```
2017-10-10-hello-world.md
```

The structure of the blog post file should be as following:

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: <TITLE OF YOUR BLOGPOST>
date:   <DATE OF YOUR BLOGPOST LIKE '2017-10-10 13:50:39'>
categories: <LIST OF SPACE SEPARATED CATEGORIES>
---

<BODY OF YOUR BLOGPOST>
```

## Updating the feedback form shortlink ↪️

We are using a **dynamic** shortlink for the events feedback form. The shortlink is [http://bit.ly/gdgfback](http://bit.ly/gdgfback). To change the destination of the shortlink please edit the [`feedbackform.md`](https://github.com/gdgpisa/gdgpisa.github.io/tree/master/feedbackform.md) file:

```markdown
---
layout: page
redirect_to: "http://example.com"
permalink: /feedbackform/
---
```

And change the `redirect_to` field to the desired one.
